# Flask Chatbot

## Demo
The demo is running on render.com, so if it was inactive, it will take a minute or so to boot up again, so please be patient. The chatbot is slower because of the host.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using requirments.txt

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
    ```env
    API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

## Usage

- Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
- Interact with the chatbot by typing your questions and receiving responses.
